# AuboEngine
Game Engine based on Box 2D

Everything here works with Finit State Machines, everything.

Levels, Characters, Objectives...

Box2D handles the physics simulations for now.

The goal is to let the user generate the entire game with almost no lines of code, the entire gameplay mechanics and game elements should be described in files (.xml for now).
